# CSS Animation Library

This project contains a collection of reusable CSS animations for various effects such as visibility, rotation, scaling, and directional movements. Additionally, it includes predefined timing functions and duration presets for easy customization.

## Animations Included

### Visibility Animation
- `animShow`: Fades in an element over time.

### Rotation Animations
- `animRotateClockwise`: Rotates an element 360 degrees in a clockwise direction.
- `animRotateCounterClockwise`: Rotates an element 360 degrees in a counterclockwise direction.

### Scaling Animations
- `animScaleUp`: Enlarges an element from scale 0 to 1.
- `animScaleDown`: Shrinks an element from scale 2 to 1.
- `animScaleDownMedium`: Shrinks an element from scale 3.5 to 1.
- `animScaleDownLarge`: Shrinks an element from scale 5 to 1.

### Directional Animations
- `animSlideLeftToRight`: Moves an element from left to right.
- `animSlideRightToLeft`: Moves an element from right to left.
- `animSlideUpToDown`: Moves an element from top to bottom.
- `animSlideDownToUp`: Moves an element from bottom to top.

### Timing Functions
- `animEaseOut`: Applies an ease-out effect.
- `animEaseIn`: Applies an ease-in effect.
- `animEaseInOut`: Applies an ease-in-out effect.

### Duration Presets
- Multiple predefined duration classes ranging from `1s` to `10.75s` for easy timing adjustments.

## Usage
To use an animation, simply apply the corresponding class to an element:

```html
<div class="animShow animDuration2s animEaseOut">Hello World!</div>
```

## Future Enhancements
I may add more animations in the future, including additional effects, transitions, and variations to further expand this library.
